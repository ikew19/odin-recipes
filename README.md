The current project is about building a basic recipe website.

I will have go applied the basics of HTML. This essentially involves creating a properly structured HTML page, displaying our HTML file (web page) on the Internet using the Google Chrome browser and standard HTML elements, and finally linking to other web pages. 
In additional to that, I will have tracked and committed some changes in the global repository on Github
