        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <strong><li>Marinate the chicken</li></strong>
            <ul><li>Pat the chicken pieces dry.</li><li>In a bowl, combine yogurt, lemon juice, ginger-garlic paste, and a mix of spices: turmeric, chili powder, garam masala, cumin, salt.</li>
            <li>Add the chicken pieces, coat them well, cover and refrigerate. Minimum 30 minutes; better if a few hours or overnight.</li></ul>
            <strong><li>Cook the chicken</li></strong>
            <ul><li>Heat oil (and a little butter if you like) in a pan over medium-high heat.</li>
            <li>Add the marinated chicken and cook until the pieces are lightly browned and partially cooked through. They will finish cooking in the sauce.</li>
            <li>Remove the chicken from the pan and set aside.</li></ul>
            <strong><li>Prepare the sauce</li></strong>
            <ul><li>In the same pan, melt butter (and/or oil) and add the chopped onion. Sauté until translucent or light golden.</li>
            <li>Add ginger-garlic paste, stir for a minute until fragrant.</li>
            <li>Add spices: cumin, garam masala, coriander powder, chili/paprika etc. Toast them briefly to release aroma.</li>
            <li>Add the tomato puree or chopped tomatoes, sugar (if using), salt, and let the mixture simmer until the sauce starts to thicken and the raw tomato flavour softens.</li>
            <li>Add the cream and kasuri methi (fenugreek leaves) toward the end, stir to combine. This gives that rich creamy and slightly aromatic finish.</li></ul>
            <strong><li>Combine chicken and sauce</li></strong>
            <ul><li>Return the partially-cooked chicken pieces into the sauce. Mix thoroughly so the sauce coats the chicken.</li>
            <li>Let everything simmer together on low heat for about 5-10 minutes (or more) so the chicken finishes cooking and absorbs the sauce flavour.</li></ul>
            <strong><li>Finish and serve</li></strong>
            <ul><li>Serve with warm cheese naan.</li></ul>
        </ol>
